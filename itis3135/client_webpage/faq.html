        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        <h3>Do you have questions for us? Maybe we can help!</h3>
        <p>We commonly get questions whether it's about our products or our business as a whole.
            Don't spend hours browsing the internet for your answer, let us answer them here!
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Do I have to supply my own materials if I wan't something engraved?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Here at Detroit Style & Designs we don't require you to give us materials. We contract with local
            and regional suppliers to ensure our products are made of the highest quality. But if you wish to
            supply your own materials, we only require you to pay for shipping and nothing else!
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>How long do your products take to ship once purchased?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We strive to provide quick service while also ensuring our products are of top quality. 
            Once an order is placed, if the product is not already in stock or it is a custom product
            we aim to ship your package within two business days. For out of stock items or custom items
            shipping times may vary based on the availability and complexness of the item in question.
        </p>
