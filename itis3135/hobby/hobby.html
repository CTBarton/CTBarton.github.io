            <h3>My Personal Introduction to Car Photography</h3>
            <p>For a little background of me and how I got into this hobby, ever since I was a kid I have always been fascinated by cars.
                Growing up my dad and his friends always had awesome and modified cars or motorcycles. We would watch TV shows about cars and
                build scale models of cars. During the covid pandemic while I was sitting at home most days with nothing to do, 
                I decided to take up photography and to be more specific, car photography. So on Christmas of 2020 I got myself a brand 
                new camera and I took off my journey from there.
            </p>

                <figcaption><i>Picture of my personal car on a cloudy day</i></figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>Through my passion for cars, I made many new friends. I started being more social, going to events, meetups, and other things
                of that nature. The other nice thing about photography is you're always looking for that perfect shot. In doing so, you find 
                yourself exploring different areas and coming across places you might not know existed.

            <h3>About Car Photography</h3>
            <p>Car photography is a exciting and creative art form. Car photographers often have to discover unique locations to make their photos stand out from the rest. There are
                possibly hundreds of millions of professional and amateur photographers in the world and everyone wants to leave their own mark. You have to find a balance when taking these 
                photos. From finding the perfect background, having good lighting, and overall knowing your own camera and its capabilities.
                 It's also a very friendly and welcoming hobby to have. People do not have issues with helping others
                learn how to become better photographers. 
            </p>

                AI Used: DALL-E </i></p>
        </figure>
        
        <p>As I mentioned earlier, the entire community is very welcoming. People often will share tips and tricks they have found or learned to capture better photos.
            If it's something you're interested in, you can even start a social media page where you document your photography journey. If you have a passion for cars and a keen eye, 
            car photography might be something you're interested in. This webpage will talk more in depth about car photography and maybe it'll make you realize it's a hobby you want to try for yourself.

            <h2>When</h2>
            <h3>When is the best time to take photos?</h3>
            <p>The best times to take photos varies. The weather such as if its cloudy or sunny, windy or calm can all impact the feeling of your photo. Another
                big thing to consider is the color of the car you're taking a photo of. Is the car a bright, neutral, or dark color? These are all things you need to keep
                in the back of your mind as a car photographer. Just as an example I will show two pictures in very different conditions.
            </p>

            <figure>
                <img src = "images/IMG_0441.JPG" alt = "Motorcycle at night in low light" width = "612" height = "408">
                <figcaption><i>Motorcycle in low light conditions</i></figcaption>
                <p>In this photo, it was very low light. It was dark outside in the middle of the night. There was no natural light and the only light i had available to me 
                    was a street lamp right above my head. Now you have to ask yourself, what feeling does this picture impose? Does the low light make it mysterious?
                </p>
                <img src = "images/IMG_0209.JPG" alt = "Two cars in sunlight" width = "612" height = "408">
                <figcaption><i>Two Cars in Sunlight</i></figcaption>
                <p>Now for this next picture, it's very different than the first. In this picture it's sunny outside with light coming in from every
                    angle the camera is pointing. Now this picture doesn't have the same feeling as the first. It doesn't feel mysterious, you can see the car perfectly and all
                    the details around it.
                 </p>
            </figure>

            <p>
                I used these two photos as an example because I think it highlights when it's good to take photos. It all depends what you want the viewer to feel when they
                see the photo. You might see a really cool car and want to show it off. In that case it's better if it's sunny outside and bright. That way you can highlight all
                the small details on the car that you wouldn't be able to see in a darker photo.
            </p>

            <h2>Where</h2>
            <h3>Where Do I Find Cars to Photograph?</h3>
            <p>There are many different ways to find cars to photograph. Firstly you can start by photographing your own
                car like I did. It takes some time to get good at it, but if you keep learning you will become a pro in no time.
                In Charlotte specifically, since it is a large city, there's a bunch of events that are always going on that you can go to and practice.
            </p>

            <figcaption><i>Photo I took at a local drag racing strip</i></figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Most people in the car community are very friendly. You can usually find information on car meets on
            popular social media sites like Instagram or Snapchat. Another option I found is to find a local drag strip
            or something similar and see when they host events. If you live close to Mooresville NC, there is a local
            drag strip there that hosts events on the weekends.

            <h2>How</h2>
            <h3>How Do I Get Started?</h3>
            <p>If you are interested in this hobby but you don't know how to get started, let this be a sort of guide. If you are a true beginner
                you don't need much to get started in this hobby. If you don't have the funds for a camera, you can use your phone! Many 
                modern phones have extremely good cameras and if you're just starting out, this is a good choice as you won't need hundreds
                of dollars in camera equipment and you can practice and learn how to take better photos. Below is a table detailing the most popular
                phones in 2023 and their camera specifications.

            <p>To help put the table into perspective, my camera, a Cannon EOS Rebel SL3 has a 24.1 mega pixel sensor and it costs around $650.00.
                 If you have a modern phone chances are you have a camera that is either half the quality of a standard handheld camera, or 
                 you have a camera that surpases it. To reiterate, if you do not have the extra funds to buy a camera, BUT you have a phone, 
                 it is a great starting block to get into photography.

            <h2>Why</h2>
            <h3>Why Do I Enjoy It?</h3>
            <p>One of the reasons I enjoy photograhpy so much is that it's relaxing. When I'm taking photos, I'm not worried
                about anything else thats going on around me besides what's being seen through my camera. Much like how 
                some people may take a walk to relax, as it provides some peace and alone time, car photograhpy for me is much the same.
            </p>

                <figcaption><i>Personal photo of the rear of my car</i></figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>Car photography also doesn't have to be just a hobby. When a company needs to advertise their new car
                what do they do? They take pictures or videos of it. Photography also can capture that sense of beauty in something.
                It can make people think about the craftsmenship and how many hours were spent in the drawing room designing a car.
                Car Photography is also one of those hobbies where if you practice enough and you love it, you can very much make
                a living out of it.
